# Welcome to Antoine YANG's Blog

After noticing that it's been more than one year since I joined _**GitHub**_,

I decided to run a blog on _**GitHub Pages**_.

As a newbie of front-end,

I want to mark and share some ideas when I learn from my study and programming.

It'll be wonderful if you get to know me through this blog.



## Technology Stack

- **React**
- **typescript**

These two above are my favorite techs at this time.

Just as what I did in most of the recently working repositories,

I will use **React + typescript** to develop my own blog,

Of course, with **GitHub Pages**.



## Language

I will try my best to write my articles in _English_,

However I am not good at that,

Thus I believe sometimes I will use my mother tongue - that is to say, _Chinese_,

If it does make some inconvenience,

I will consider translating them then.

By the way,

I may also use _Japanese_ because I sincerely like it and I am now learning it.





**Thanks**
